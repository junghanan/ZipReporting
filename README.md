# ZipReporting

**A Purpose of the Project**
This project was initiated since a previous process involved manual data pulls using Odata with Excel and used Excel functions (SUMIFS and XLOOKUP) to calculate how much of the sales need to be reported to manufacturers. 

**SQL/Automation**
1. Use SQL Server (involved writing SQL codes) to pull data instantly. Pulling data with Odata took more than one hour and causes to crash multiple times during the data pull.

2. Use KNIME (<a href = https://www.knime.com/software-overview>Analytics Platform</a>) to automate calculations that distinguish which sales need to be reported every month to the manufacturers and create final reports with different formatting automatically. 

**Results**

1. Automated 2 processes: Zip Reporting for US and Canada (2 different companies).

2. Reduced 16 hours of work to 15 minutes every month. 

3. All reports generated with 100% accuracy (validated manually multiple times to make sure the automation works properly).
